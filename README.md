# PRODIGY_DS_01

# Data Analysis and Visualization with Python

This repository contains a Python script for data analysis and visualization tasks performed on a dataset. The script demonstrates various data exploration techniques and visualization methods using popular libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn.

## Getting Started

To get started, follow these instructions:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/jp0027006/PRODIGY_DS_01.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd PRODIGY_DS_01
```

3. Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed. You can install them using pip:

```
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

4. Download the dataset from given link:

```

```

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The Python script `PRODIGY_DS_01.ipynb` contains the following steps for EDA:

- **Uploading Data**: The script loads the dataset into a pandas DataFrame for further analysis.
  
- **Data Exploration**: It explores the dataset by displaying its structure, including its shape, columns, and information.

- **Data Cleaning**: Missing values are handled by forward filling (`method="ffill"`).

- **Visualization**:
  - Histograms are used to visualize the distribution of values for each year.
  - A horizontal bar chart is plotted to display the total values per year.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Usage

- Open the google colab `PRODIGY_DS_01.ipynb` to view the analysis script.
- Run each cell of the notebook to execute the code and visualize the results.
